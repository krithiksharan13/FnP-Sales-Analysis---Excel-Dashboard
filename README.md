## Executive Summary

This repository contains the analytical dashboard and data insights for the FnP Project, which explores customer purchasing behavior, product trends, and overall sales performance using structured datasets and pivot-based analysis.

### Key Insights

- **Correlation Between Quantity and Price**  
  The analysis shows a negligible correlation (0.003) between the quantity of products ordered and their price. This suggests that pricing has minimal impact on order volume, allowing for more flexible pricing strategies without affecting demand.

- **Order Timing Trends**  
  Most customer orders are concentrated within specific timeframes. This reveals clear purchasing patterns which can inform marketing automation, time-based promotions, and resource planning during peak periods.

- **Customer Behavior**  
  While not fully detailed in this sheet, insights into customer segmentation, repeat purchases, and high-value profiles are expected. These are vital for personalized marketing, loyalty programs, and churn reduction strategies.

- **Product and Sales Performance**  
  The dashboard likely includes visual data summaries such as top-performing products, regional sales distribution, and seasonal trends. These visuals aid in making informed decisions around inventory, sales tactics, and product focus.
